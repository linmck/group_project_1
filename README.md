# Investigating Drug Abuse Relationships

### Team Members: Lindsey McKenna, James Brunhs, Paula Caudilla

Project Description/Outline: Investigate relationships between drug use and other trends over the same period of time.

### Research Questions to Answer: 
  * What percentage of deaths by region are drug/alcohol related?
  * What percentage of drug deaths are opiods? Illicit drugs? Alcohol?
  * What is the correlation between average household income and drug mortality?
  * What is the correlation between homeless population and drug mortality?
  * Is there a correlation between drug-related convictions and deaths?

### Datasets to be used:
Census Population - https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2016/state/asrh/
Drug Overdose Data - https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm
Point in Time Estimates of Homelessness - https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5783/2018-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us/
Total Annual Drug Arrests - https://www.drugwarfacts.org/node/234#

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
  * Define states by Region to bin later
  * Locate alcohol mortality data, insert into drug data
  * Munge, truncate, etc data to be sucinct as possible, focusing on 2017
  * Build dataframes (pivot?) with focuses on each question
  * Locate national crime data, bin by definded region, isolate drug related convictions

### Hypothesis: 
Higher rates of homelessness and lower average household incomes have a direct impact on substance use

### Charts:
* Compare Drug Related Mortality to Household Income
* Compare Drug Related Mortality to Homelessness
* Compare Drug Related Mortality to Drug Arrests
* Household Income per Region
* Drug Related Deaths per Region
* Homelessness per Region
* Drug Arrests per Region
* Named Drugs (Illicit, Opiods, Alcohol) Death Counts Region 1
* Named Drugs (Illicit, Opiods, Alcohol) Death Counts Region 2
* Named Drugs (Illicit, Opiods, Alcohol) Death Counts Region 3
* Named Drugs (Illicit, Opiods, Alcohol) Death Counts Region 4
